Changes since 1.1
=================

* nothing notable yet

Changes since 1.0
=================

* bit-vector solver now has a specialized decision procedure for unsigned bit-
  vector inequalities
* numerous important bug fixes, performance improvements, and usability
  improvements
* support for multiline input in interactive mode
* Win32-building support via mingw
* SMT-LIB get-model output now is easier to machine-parse: contains (model...)
* user patterns for quantifier instantiation are now supported in the
  SMT-LIBv1.2 parser
* --finite-model-find was incomplete when using --incremental, now fixed
* the E-matching procedure is slightly improved
* Boolean terms are now supported in datatypes
* tuple and record support have been added to the compatibility library
* driver verbosity change: for printing all commands as they're executed, you
  now need verbosity level >= 3 (e.g., -vvv) instead of level 1 (-v).  This
  allows tracing the solver's activities (with -v and -vv) without having too
  much output.
* to make CVC4 quieter in abnormal (e.g., "warning" conditions), you can
  use -q.  Previously, this would silence all output (including "sat" or
  "unsat") as well.  Now, single -q silences messages and warnings, and
  double -qq silences all output (except on exception or signal).
